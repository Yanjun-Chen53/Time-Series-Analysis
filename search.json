    "text": "Global Renewable Energy Growth Trends\nThe data, sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA), highlights a clear structural shift in the global energy system. While fossil fuels and hydro power historically dominated capacity additions, the past two decades have been characterized by the rapid acceleration of solar and wind energy. In particular, solar capacity has exhibited exponential growth since the early 2010s, outpacing all other sources, while wind energy has demonstrated steady, sustained expansion. By contrast, hydro capacity additions have remained relatively stable, reflecting geographical and environmental constraints. Nuclear additions appear limited in scale, indicating stagnation compared to renewables. Overall, the figure underscores the transition towards low-carbon energy systems, with solar and wind emerging as the primary drivers of global renewable capacity growth.\n\n\nCode\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/renewable-capacity.csv\")\np &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Capacity, color = Entity)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Global Renewable Energy Capacity by Source\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparison across Solar, Wind, Hydro, etc.\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Capacity (GW)\",\n    color = \"Energy Source\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\ninteractive_plot &lt;- ggplotly(p, tooltip = c(\"x\", \"y\", \"Entity\"))\ninteractive_plot"

    "text": "Oil Prices vs. Renewable and Traditional Energy ETFs\nThis figure presents a comparative time-series analysis of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices (sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, FRED) alongside two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Yahoo Finance: the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), representing the renewable energy sector, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), representing traditional fossil-fuel–based energy firms.\nThe visualization employs a dual-axis line chart, with WTI oil prices displayed on the left axis and the ETF prices displayed on the right axis. This design enables a clear comparison of the dynamics between commodity markets and equity markets tied to energy. The temporal alignment of the series allows for the identification of co-movements and divergences.\nFrom the figure, one can observe several key patterns. Periods of sharp volatility in oil prices—such as the downturn around 2008 and the collapse in early 2020—are mirrored by fluctuations in energy-sector equities, though the magnitude and persistence of these responses differ across renewable and traditional ETFs. Notably, while XLE tends to correlate more closely with oil price movements, ICLN demonstrates partial decoupling, reflecting the structural shift toward renewable energy sources whose valuation drivers are less directly dependent on crude oil prices.\n\n\nCode\netf_symbols &lt;- c(\"ICLN\", \"XLE\")\n\netf_data &lt;- tq_get(etf_symbols,\n                   from = \"2005-01-01\",\n                   to = Sys.Date(),\n                   get = \"stock.prices\")\n\netf_data &lt;- etf_data %&gt;%\n  select(symbol, date, adjusted)\n\nwti &lt;- read.csv(\"data/WTIprice.csv\")\n\nwti &lt;- wti %&gt;%\n  rename(date = observation_date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %&gt;%\n  rename(WTI = POILWTIUSDM) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WTI))\n\nfig &lt;- plot_ly() %&gt;%\n  \n  add_lines(data = wti, x = ~date, y = ~WTI,\n            name = \"WTI Crude Oil\", yaxis = \"y1\",\n            line = list(color = \"black\")) %&gt;%\n  \n  add_lines(data = subset(etf_data, symbol == \"ICLN\"),\n            x = ~date, y = ~adjusted,\n            name = \"ICLN (Renewable ETF)\", yaxis = \"y2\",\n            line = list(color = \"green\")) %&gt;%\n  \n  add_lines(data = subset(etf_data, symbol == \"XLE\"),\n            x = ~date, y = ~adjusted,\n            name = \"XLE (Energy ETF)\", yaxis = \"y2\",\n            line = list(color = \"blue\")) %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"WTI Oil Price vs Renewable (ICLN) and Energy (XLE) ETFs\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Date\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"WTI Oil Price (USD)\", side = \"left\"),\n    yaxis2 = list(title = \"ETF Price (USD)\", overlaying = \"y\", side = \"right\"),\n    legend = list(x = 0.05, y = 0.95)\n  )\n\nfig"

The increasing reliance on natural gas highlights its strategic importance in meeting rising energy demand while supporting decarbonization goals, positioning it as a central component of the evolving energy mix.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnuclear_df &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(Description == \"Nuclear Electric Power\") %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Value)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Value = as.numeric(Value)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Date)\n\nts_nuclear &lt;- ts(nuclear_df$Value,\n              start = c(min(nuclear_df$Year), min(nuclear_df$Month)),\n              frequency = 12)\n\np &lt;- autoplot(ts_nuclear, colour = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Nuclear Electric Power Electricity Net Generation\") +\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe net electricity generation from nuclear power remains relatively stable over time, reflecting its role as a consistent baseload energy source. Although growth has been limited compared to renewables, nuclear energy continues to provide reliable, low-carbon electricity that supports energy security and decarbonization objectives. Its long-term stability highlights both the technological maturity of nuclear power and the challenges of expanding capacity due to safety concerns, high capital costs, and lengthy regulatory processes.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhy_df &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(Description == \"Conventional Hydroelectric Power\") %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Value)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Value = as.numeric(Value)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Date)\n\nts_hy &lt;- ts(hy_df$Value,\n              start = c(min(hy_df$Year), min(hy_df$Month)),\n              frequency = 12)\n\np &lt;- autoplot(ts_hy, colour = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Hydroelectric Power Electricity Net Generation\") +\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe net electricity generation from hydroelectric power shows a relatively steady pattern with modest fluctuations, largely influenced by hydrological conditions and regional water resource availability. While it remains a mature and established renewable source, the absence of significant long-term growth reflects geographical and environmental constraints that limit large-scale expansion. Nevertheless, hydroelectricity continues to play a crucial role in providing reliable renewable energy and grid stability, particularly through its flexibility in balancing intermittent solar and wind generation.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsolar_df &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(Description == \"Solar\") %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Value)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Value = as.numeric(Value)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Date)\n\nts_solar &lt;- ts(solar_df$Value,\n              start = c(min(solar_df$Year), min(solar_df$Month)),\n              frequency = 12)\n\np &lt;- autoplot(ts_solar, colour = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Solar Electricity Net Generation\") +\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe net electricity generation from solar energy demonstrates a strong upward trajectory, reflecting rapid technological advancements, declining production costs, and supportive policy frameworks. This rise underscores the increasing competitiveness of solar power within the broader energy market, as well as its central role in advancing decarbonization and sustainable development objectives. The accelerating growth also highlights shifting investment priorities toward renewable energy and the expanding societal demand for cleaner electricity sources.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nwti &lt;- read.csv(\"data/WTIprice.csv\")\nwti &lt;- wti %&gt;%\n  rename(date = observation_date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %&gt;%\n  rename(WTI = POILWTIUSDM) %&gt;%\n  mutate(WTI = as.numeric(WTI))\n\nts_wti &lt;- ts(wti$WTI,\n              start = c(1990, 1),\n              frequency = 12)\n\np &lt;- autoplot(ts_wti, colour = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"WTI Oil price\")+\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p)   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe historical trend of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices is characterized by pronounced volatility, reflecting the commodity’s sensitivity to global supply-demand dynamics, geopolitical tensions, and macroeconomic cycles. Periods of sharp spikes, such as during the mid-2000s oil boom, and dramatic collapses, such as in 2008 and 2020, illustrate the market’s exposure to both financial crises and unprecedented demand shocks. Despite these fluctuations, WTI oil remains a key global benchmark, and its long-term movements serve as a critical indicator of energy market stability, investment strategies, and the broader transition toward alternative energy sources.\n\n\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- autoplot(ts_np, colour = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Henry Hub Natural Gas price \")+\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Henry Hub natural gas price series exhibits strong seasonal patterns superimposed on a gradually increasing trend. The clear and recurring intra-annual fluctuations reflect consistent seasonal demand cycles, likely driven by heating and cooling needs. Notable volatility spikes, such as those observed in 2008 and 2022, suggest the influence of external shocks or supply disruptions. Unlike the Renewable Energy ETF (ICLN), this series demonstrates more regular and predictable dynamics, indicative of a mature commodity market responsive to both fundamental and cyclical factors.\n\n\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- autoplot(ts_icln, colour = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Renewable Energy ETF (ICLN) \")+\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe historical price trend of the Renewable Energy ETF (ICLN) reveals a long-term upward movement interrupted by significant short-term volatility. The sharp rise during 2020–2021 likely reflects heightened investor interest in clean energy, possibly influenced by political shifts and global ESG momentum. However, the subsequent decline suggests either market correction or reduced optimism. While no clear seasonal pattern is observed, the data displays cyclic behavior tied to broader macroeconomic and policy-related factors, implying that the clean energy sector is both promising and highly reactive to external stimuli.\n\n\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- autoplot(ts_xle, colour = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)\")+\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series of the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) displays a long-term upward trend with significant cyclical fluctuations that broadly align with major energy market dynamics. Periods of sharp decline, such as during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic shock, indicate the fund’s sensitivity to macroeconomic downturns and global oil price collapses. While no clear seasonality is evident, the repeated boom–bust cycles reflect the commodity-linked nature of the energy sector, driven by supply-demand imbalances, geopolitical shocks, and structural shifts in global energy consumption. Notably, the strong recovery after 2020 underscores renewed investor confidence in traditional energy despite the concurrent growth of renewable alternatives. This suggests that fossil fuel–linked equities remain resilient and strategically significant in the evolving energy mix."

    "text": "The Big Picture\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global shift to clean energy is one of the most significant transformations shaping the 21st-century economy, with implications spanning technology, markets, policy, and finance. This analysis will consider the following five main areas:\nRenewable Energy Growth and Seasonality: The expansion of solar, wind, and hydropower is central to the energy transition. However, their seasonal and intermittent nature introduces challenges for grid stability and demand–supply balancing. Understanding these patterns is essential to evaluating the resilience and scalability of renewable energy systems.\nFossil Fuel Decline and Market Volatility: As coal, oil, and natural gas face structural decline, markets are experiencing heightened volatility and price fluctuations. Analyzing these dynamics provides insights into the risks for energy security and the broader macroeconomic consequences of decarbonization.\nechnological Innovation (EVs and Batteries): Advances in electric vehicles, battery storage, hydrogen, and smart grids serve as key enablers of the clean energy transition. This section will examine how technological progress reduces costs, enhances efficiency, and accelerates the adoption of sustainable energy systems.\nPolicy and Regulation: The global energy transition is profoundly shaped by regulatory frameworks and government interventions. Carbon pricing, renewable portfolio standards, subsidies, and international agreements—particularly the Paris Agreement—are decisive factors in aligning national policies with global climate goals.\nGlobal Investment and Capital Flows: Financing the clean energy transition requires large-scale capital mobilization. The rise of green finance, ESG-driven strategies, and fossil fuel divestment initiatives highlights the financial sector’s pivotal role in driving systemic change. This section will investigate how capital allocation patterns influence the speed and direction of global decarbonization."

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\nSeasonality in Renewable Energy\nPrakash et al. (2025) investigate the role of seasonal and weather-driven variation in renewable energy production, with a focus on solar and wind power. Using SARIMA and hybrid decomposition models, they show that seasonal patterns in electricity generation strongly influence short-term grid balancing and long-term planning. Their findings indicate that reliable time-series modeling of seasonality is essential for forecasting renewable output and preventing mismatches between energy supply and demand. This work highlights the importance of seasonality in renewable energy markets and supports the use of SARIMA and SARIMAX approaches in analyzing cyclical adoption patterns in our project1.\nVolatility in Fossil Fuel and Energy Finance\nNarayan and Sharma (2019) examine volatility clustering in oil and natural gas prices, applying GARCH and EGARCH models to capture periods of heightened market uncertainty. Their results demonstrate that fossil fuel prices are subject to strong regime shifts triggered by geopolitical shocks and OPEC decisions, producing spillovers in energy-related financial markets2. Similarly, Wang and Zhou (2021) find that policy announcements often induce short-lived but sharp volatility spikes in energy stock indices3. These studies underscore the need to apply GARCH-type volatility models when studying fossil fuels and renewable-related financial assets, as fluctuations in fossil prices are deeply tied to the broader energy transition.\nTechnological Change and EV Adoption\nNykvist and Nilsson (2015) analyze the long-run cost trajectory of lithium-ion batteries, documenting a steep decline that has accelerated global electric vehicle (EV) adoption4. Their study highlights a learning-curve dynamic, where technological improvements and scale economies reduce costs over time, producing a logistic diffusion pattern in EV sales. Zaino et al. (2024) extend this analysis by modeling EV adoption using ARIMAX and logistic growth models, showing that cost reductions coupled with infrastructure investment generate rapid market penetration5. Together, these studies illustrate the technological drivers of clean energy adoption and provide a foundation for modeling structural transitions in EV markets.\nPolicy Shocks and Carbon Pricing\nRafaty et al. (2022) explore the effects of climate policy interventions—such as carbon pricing and renewable energy subsidies—on investment and adoption patterns across OECD countries6. Their study finds that policy shocks often create measurable breaks in time series, with rapid increases in renewable deployment following major policy announcements. Similarly, World Bank (2023) reports demonstrate that countries implementing carbon pricing achieve more stable emissions reductions compared to those relying solely on voluntary targets7. These findings emphasize the importance of including exogenous policy dummies and interrupted time-series models to capture the role of policy in accelerating the energy transition.\nGlobal Energy Markets and Transition Risks\nBloombergNEF (2023) reviews global investment trends in renewable energy and battery storage, finding that despite rising capital flows into clean technologies, fossil fuel assets continue to dominate some regions8. Their analysis shows that currency fluctuations, commodity price swings, and investor sentiment significantly affect the pace of capital reallocation from fossil fuels to renewables. This aligns with the view that the energy transition involves both structural long-term change and short-term volatility, requiring a blend of VAR, ARFIMA, and deep learning models to forecast interconnected global markets."

In the original-scale differences, variability increases toward the end—evidence of heteroskedasticity and residual non-stationarity. The log transform stabilizes the variance, so the differenced log series fluctuates around a roughly constant mean with nearly constant variation. However, the ACF still shows seasonal dependence (spikes at lags 12, 24, …). To address this remaining structure, we should apply a seasonal difference on top of the ordinary difference—i.e., compute —to remove the seasonal correlation.\n\n\nCode\n# Extract vectors\ndates &lt;- wind_df$Date\ny     &lt;- as.numeric(wind_df$Value)\n\ndiff_orig &lt;- diff(y)\ndiff_log  &lt;- diff(log(pmax(y, .Machine$double.eps)))  # safe log if any zeros\ndate_d    &lt;- dates[-1]\n\n# Data frames for ggplot\ndf_orig &lt;- data.frame(Date = date_d, Diff = diff_orig)\ndf_log  &lt;- data.frame(Date = date_d, Diff = diff_log)\n\n# Panel 1: differenced original\np1 &lt;- ggplot(df_orig, aes(x = Date, y = Diff)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"First Difference (Original Scale)\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"First Difference\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"5 years\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Panel 2: differenced log\np2 &lt;- ggplot(df_log, aes(x = Date, y = Diff)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"firebrick\") +\n  labs(title = \"First Difference (Log Scale)\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"First Difference (log)\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"5 years\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Stack vertically\np1 / p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF: Original series. Here it is evident that there is very high autocorrelation, including seasonal correlation, with highly significant serial correlation at seasonal lags. However, due to heteroscedasticity in the data, we need a log transformation.\nACF: log(xt) — ordinary diff. Here we can see the ordinary serial correlation is minimal compared to the raw series data ACF, but there is high seasonal correlation remains at lags 12, 24, etc. So we will need seasonal differencing.\nACF: log(xt) — seasonal diff. Here, when we apply seasonal differencing, we can see that the seasonal correlation has become very small, but the series is still not stationary due to high correlation from the ordinary lags. Our goal is to convert the data into a stationary process as a first step for our modeling process; therefore, we need both ordinary differencing on top of seasonal differencing.\nACF: log(xt) — ordinary + seasonal diff. With both ordinary and seasonal differencing, the series is now more stationary.\n\n\nCode\n# Log series (safe for zeros)\nlog_ts  &lt;- log(pmax(ts_wind, .Machine$double.eps))\n\n# Differencing\nd_log   &lt;- diff(log_ts)              # ordinary diff of log\nsd_log  &lt;- diff(log_ts, lag = 12)    # seasonal diff of log\nosd_log &lt;- diff(d_log,  lag = 12)    # first + seasonal diff of log\n\n# ACF plots\np1 &lt;- ggAcf(ts_wind,   lag.max = 60) + ggtitle(\"ACF: Original series\") +\n  theme_minimal()\np2 &lt;- ggAcf(d_log,   lag.max = 60) + ggtitle(\"ACF: log(xt)-ordinary diff)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\np3 &lt;- ggAcf(sd_log,  lag.max = 60) + ggtitle(\"ACF: log(xt)-seasonal diff\") +\n  theme_minimal()\np4 &lt;- ggAcf(osd_log, lag.max = 60) + ggtitle(\"ACF:log(xt)-ordinary + seasonal diff\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Arrange in a 2x2 grid\n(p1 | p2) / (p3 | p4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(osd_log)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  osd_log\nDickey-Fuller = -9.8337, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\np = 0:4, d = 1, q = 1, P = 0:1, D = 1, Q = 1\n\n\nCode\nacf &lt;-  ggAcf(osd_log, lag.max = 60) + ggtitle(\"ACF:log(xt)-ordinary + seasonal diff\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\npacf &lt;- ggPacf(osd_log, lag.max = 60) + ggtitle(\"PACF:log(xt)-ordinary + seasonal diff\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ngrid.arrange(acf, pacf, nrow=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nSARIMA.c=function(p1,p2,q1,q2,P1,P2,Q1,Q2,data){\n  \n  temp=c()\n  d=1\n  D=1\n  s=12\n  \n  i=1\n  temp= data.frame()\n  ls=matrix(rep(NA,9*35),nrow=35)\n  for (p in p1:p2)\n  {\n    for(q in q1:q2)\n    {\n      for(P in P1:P2)\n      {\n        for(Q in Q1:Q2)\n        {\n          if(p+d+q+P+D+Q&lt;=9)\n          {\n            model&lt;- Arima(data,order=c(p-1,d,q-1),seasonal=c(P-1,D,Q-1))\n            ls[i,]= c(p-1,d,q-1,P-1,D,Q-1,model$aic,model$bic,model$aicc)\n            i=i+1\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  temp= as.data.frame(ls)\n  names(temp)= c(\"p\",\"d\",\"q\",\"P\",\"D\",\"Q\",\"AIC\",\"BIC\",\"AICc\")\n  temp\n}\n\noutput=SARIMA.c(p1=1,p2=5,q1=1,q2=3,P1=1,P2=3,Q1=1,Q2=3,data=log_ts)\noutput[which.min(output$AIC),] \n\n\n   p d q P D Q       AIC       BIC      AICc\n25 1 1 1 0 1 1 -311.6715 -296.9508 -311.5326\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardized Residuals: The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no visible trend or seasonal pattern.

In the original-scale differences, variability increases toward the end—evidence of heteroskedasticity and residual non-stationarity. The log transform stabilizes the variance, so the differenced log series fluctuates around a roughly constant mean with nearly constant variation. However, the ACF still shows seasonal dependence (spikes at lags 12, 24, …). To address this remaining structure, we should apply a seasonal difference on top of the ordinary difference—i.e., compute —to remove the seasonal correlation.\n\n\nCode\n# Extract vectors\ndates &lt;- solar_df$Date\ny     &lt;- as.numeric(solar_df$Value)\n\ndiff_orig &lt;- diff(y)\ndiff_log  &lt;- diff(log(pmax(y, .Machine$double.eps)))  # safe log if any zeros\ndate_d    &lt;- dates[-1]\n\n# Data frames for ggplot\ndf_orig &lt;- data.frame(Date = date_d, Diff = diff_orig)\ndf_log  &lt;- data.frame(Date = date_d, Diff = diff_log)\n\n# Panel 1: differenced original\np1 &lt;- ggplot(df_orig, aes(x = Date, y = Diff)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"First Difference (Original Scale)\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"First Difference\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"5 years\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Panel 2: differenced log\np2 &lt;- ggplot(df_log, aes(x = Date, y = Diff)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"firebrick\") +\n  labs(title = \"First Difference (Log Scale)\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"First Difference (log)\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"5 years\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Stack vertically\np1 / p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF: Original series.

Overall, the model provides a good fit to the historical data and projects a steady growth trajectory for solar electricity generation, consistent with global energy transition trends.\n\n\nCode\nfit &lt;- Arima(log_ts, order=c(1,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1))\nfit %&gt;% forecast(h=36) %&gt;% autoplot() #next 3 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ARIMA model outperforms all benchmark models.\nThis indicates ARIMA captures both the underlying trend and seasonality of the solar generation data, making it the most reliable forecasting model among those tested.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Generate forecasts\nmean_forecast &lt;- forecast(meanf(log_ts, h = 36))\nnaive_forecast &lt;- forecast(naive(log_ts, h = 36))\nsnaive_forecast &lt;- forecast(snaive(log_ts, h = 36))\ndrift_forecast &lt;- forecast(rwf(log_ts, h = 36, drift = TRUE))\narima_forecast &lt;- forecast(fit, h = 36)\n\n# Convert forecasts to data frame\n# Extract forecasted values properly\nforecast_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  Date = seq(max(df_log$Date) %m+% months(1), by = \"month\", length.out = 36),\n  Mean = as.numeric(mean_forecast$mean),    # Extract mean forecast\n  Naive = as.numeric(naive_forecast$mean),\n  SNaive = as.numeric(snaive_forecast$mean),\n  Drift = as.numeric(drift_forecast$mean),\n  ARIMA = as.numeric(arima_forecast$mean)\n)\n\n# Plot with ggplot2\np &lt;- ggplot(solar_df, aes(x = Date, y = log(Value))) +\n  geom_line(color = \"black\", size = 1) +  # Actual Data\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = Mean, color = \"Mean\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = Naive, color = \"Naïve\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = SNaive, color = \"Seasonal Naïve\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dotdash\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = Drift, color = \"Drift\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"twodash\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = ARIMA, color = \"ARIMA Fit\"), linewidth = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Solar Electricity Net Generation Forecast\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") + ylab(\"Value\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Mean\" = \"blue\", \"Naïve\" = \"red\", \n                                \"Seasonal Naïve\" = \"green\", \"Drift\" = \"orange\", \n                                \"ARIMA Fit\" = \"purple\")) +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = \"Forecast Methods\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Compute Accuracy Metrics Safely\nget_acc &lt;- function(model, name) {\n  acc &lt;- as.data.frame(accuracy(model))\n  rownames(acc) &lt;- NULL\n  acc$Method &lt;- name\n  return(acc)\n}\n\nacc_list &lt;- list(\n  get_acc(mean_forecast, \"Mean\"),\n  get_acc(naive_forecast, \"Naïve\"),\n  get_acc(snaive_forecast, \"SNaïve\"),\n  get_acc(drift_forecast, \"Drift\"),\n  get_acc(arima_forecast, \"ARIMA\")\n)\n\nacc_df &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(acc_list)\n\nacc_summary &lt;- acc_df %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Method, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MASE, ACF1) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::distinct()\n\nprint(acc_summary)\n\n\n  Method      RMSE       MAE      MAPE      MASE         ACF1\n1   Mean 2.5126153 2.2927864 51.296079 6.8673608  0.975314008\n2  Naïve 0.4513865 0.2963849  9.040657 0.8877329  0.206852172\n3 SNaïve 0.4290561 0.3338672  6.919360 1.0000000  0.591550598\n4  Drift 0.4505947 0.2955583  9.067843 0.8852571  0.206852172\n5  ARIMA 0.2410778 0.1505371  4.232683 0.4508891 -0.006054956"

The model captures these seasonal cycles well, as seen in the repeating peaks and troughs in the forecasted period. The forecast indicates that hydroelectric generation will likely remain stable overall, without a pronounced long-term upward or downward trend. However, the wide confidence intervals suggest considerable uncertainty, emphasizing the sensitivity of hydroelectric generation to unpredictable climatic and environmental factors.

The model captures both this declining trend and the persistent seasonal fluctuations, likely associated with changes in energy demand across different months. The forecast suggests that coal generation will continue to decrease modestly over the next few years, with values remaining substantially below their early-2000s levels. The widening confidence intervals highlight growing uncertainty, possibly reflecting volatility in energy policy, fuel prices, and demand patterns. Overall, the results are consistent with the ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable alternatives.\n\n\nCode\nfit &lt;- Arima(ts_coal, order=c(1,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1))\nfit %&gt;% forecast(h=36) %&gt;% autoplot() #next 3 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ARIMA model outperforms all benchmark models.\nThis indicates ARIMA captures both the underlying trend and seasonality of the coal generation data, making it the most reliable forecasting model among those tested.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Generate forecasts\nmean_forecast &lt;- forecast(meanf(ts_coal, h = 36))\nnaive_forecast &lt;- forecast(naive(ts_coal, h = 36))\nsnaive_forecast &lt;- forecast(snaive(ts_coal, h = 36))\ndrift_forecast &lt;- forecast(rwf(ts_coal, h = 36, drift = TRUE))\narima_forecast &lt;- forecast(fit, h = 36)\n\n# Convert forecasts to data frame\n# Extract forecasted values properly\nforecast_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  Date = seq(max(coal_df$Date) %m+% months(1), by = \"month\", length.out = 36),\n  Mean = as.numeric(mean_forecast$mean),    # Extract mean forecast\n  Naive = as.numeric(naive_forecast$mean),\n  SNaive = as.numeric(snaive_forecast$mean),\n  Drift = as.numeric(drift_forecast$mean),\n  ARIMA = as.numeric(arima_forecast$mean)\n)\n\n# Plot with ggplot2\np &lt;- ggplot(coal_df, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"black\", size = 1) +  # Actual Data\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = Mean, color = \"Mean\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = Naive, color = \"Naïve\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = SNaive, color = \"Seasonal Naïve\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dotdash\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = Drift, color = \"Drift\"), linewidth = 1, linetype = \"twodash\") +\n  geom_line(data = forecast_df, aes(x = Date, y = ARIMA, color = \"ARIMA Fit\"), linewidth = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Coal Electricity Net Generation Forecast\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") + ylab(\"Value\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Mean\" = \"blue\", \"Naïve\" = \"red\", \n                                \"Seasonal Naïve\" = \"green\", \"Drift\" = \"orange\", \n                                \"ARIMA Fit\" = \"purple\")) +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = \"Forecast Methods\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Compute Accuracy Metrics Safely\nget_acc &lt;- function(model, name) {\n  acc &lt;- as.data.frame(accuracy(model))\n  rownames(acc) &lt;- NULL\n  acc$Method &lt;- name\n  return(acc)\n}\n\nacc_list &lt;- list(\n  get_acc(mean_forecast, \"Mean\"),\n  get_acc(naive_forecast, \"Naïve\"),\n  get_acc(snaive_forecast, \"SNaïve\"),\n  get_acc(drift_forecast, \"Drift\"),\n  get_acc(arima_forecast, \"ARIMA\")\n)\n\nacc_df &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(acc_list)\n\nacc_summary &lt;- acc_df %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Method, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MASE, ACF1) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::distinct()\n\nprint(acc_summary)\n\n\n  Method     RMSE       MAE      MAPE     MASE         ACF1\n1   Mean 42640.17 37209.407 40.976347 3.825499  0.937508230\n2  Naïve 14378.81 12006.462 11.190410 1.234384  0.194003508\n3 SNaïve 12907.03  9726.681 10.295471 1.000000  0.728652099\n4  Drift 14373.98 12005.322 11.164493 1.234267  0.194003508\n5  ARIMA  6423.78  4684.944  4.742525 0.481659 -0.004676138"
